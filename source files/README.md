These are the corrected files generated on [mtkeyboard.vip](mtkeyboard.vip).

The original config had one missing thing: it does not have volume mute/down/up; so I have added that on F10/F11/F12, respectively.
Also, the second key of the 5th row is mapped wrong. After trial and error I've found the right one, which is <code>KC_NUBS</code>, and I've corrected it.
