These are the corrected files generated on [mtkeyboard.vip](mtkeyboard.vip).

The original config had one missing thing: it does not have volume mute/down/up; so I have added that on the second layer in the F10/F11/F12 positions, respectively.
Also, the second key of the 5th row is mapped wrong. After trial and error I've found the right one, which is <code>KC_NUBS</code>, and I've corrected it.

You can use the .hex file with QMK Toolbox and flash it on your keyboard.

You can use the .json file to upload it into mtkeyboard.vip to inspect it and modify it.
